#### Arrays

Array is a collection of homogeneous data elements. It is a very simple data structure. The elements of an array are stored in successive memory location. Array is refered by a name and index number. Array is nice because of their simplicity and well suited for situations where the number is known. Array operation :

There are basically two types of Array.
